Enm531 Final project
The Model Building Folder has all the files required to train the machine learning model. The only code that is omitted is the simulation code as currently there is publication in submission using it. I do not have permission to share it until published. However, the results of the simulation, the structures, are in zipped file and the corresponding energy results are shared as npy files.

The Graphs folder contains all the graphs and the code used to generate it.

The Model_Results_Performance has csvs containing the result and its metric.
